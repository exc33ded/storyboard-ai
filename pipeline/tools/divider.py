    You are a professional Video Director and Creative Planner. 
    Analyze the following research and plan a high-quality whiteboard animation video.
    
    Research Material:
    ---
    {research_output}
    ---
    
    Your Task:
    1. Determine the appropriate TONE and STYLE for this video based on the topic. 
       - If it's informative/financial (like NPS/PF), use a "Documentary/Informative" style (authoritative, clear, professional).
       - If it's a historical/action story (like Shivaji Maharaj), use a "Dramatic/Narrative" style (engaging, cinematic, tense).
       - Avoid making dry informative topics "mysterious" or "thriller-like".
    2. Create a 'global_plan' that defines the Narrative Persona and Visual Aesthetic.
    3. Break the content into 10-15+ scenes.
    
    Requirements for each scene:
    - 'narration': The spoken script (aligned with the global tone).
    - 'description': A visual description for the image generator.
    - 'visual_setup': Specific instructions for this frame (e.g., "Use a 3D bar chart for comparison", "Draw a realistic map of India", "Keep it simple and schematic").
    
    Output Format (Strict JSON):
    {{
      "global_plan": {{
        "tone": "informative" | "dramatic",
        "narrative_persona": "Professional Documentary Narrator" | "Epic Storyteller" | etc.,
