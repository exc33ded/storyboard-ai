def segmentation_tool_fn(image_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Performs instance segmentation on an image.
    
    This tool follows a two-step process:
    1. It uses a Gemini model to identify major, distinct objects in the image.
    2. For each identified object, it calls a hosted SAM3 (Segment Anything Model) 
       API to generate a high-quality segmentation mask.
    
    Args:
        image_path (str): The absolute path to the input image file (PNG or JPEG).
        
    Returns:
        str: The absolute path to a JSON file containing the results.
             The JSON structure is:
             {
               "image_path": str,
               "objects": [str, ...],
